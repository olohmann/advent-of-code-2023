# Advent of Code 2023: My Chronicles 🎄⏰

Welcome to my journey through the Advent of Code 2023! In this repository, you'll find my attempts (emphasis on *attempts*) to solve the festive puzzles at a pace that snails might find admirable.

## About AoC2023 🧩

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an annual event where programmers around the world cry tears of joy and frustration as they tackle daily coding challenges. It's like a Christmas calendar, but instead of chocolate, you get a healthy dose of brain teasers!

## My Approach 🐢

- **Punctuality**: Who needs it? I'll start late and finish... well, probably never. But that's okay!
- **Code Quality**: F# die hards will surely ask "Why on earth did I write this?"
- **Coffee Intake**: Measured in gallons.

## The Journal: Highlights (or Lowlights) 🌟

- **Day 1**: Finding the edge case took... a while.
- **Day 2**: Quite smooth.

## How to Navigate This Repository 🗺️

- `01/` etc.: Where the magic happens. And by magic, I mean questionable code practices.

## Final Words 🏁

Remember, it's not about the destination; it's about the journey... and the numerous detours along the way. Enjoy!

Happy Coding and Happy Holidays! 🎅💻
